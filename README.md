# Network_Scanner_Tool
A Python-based tool for scanning networks, detecting open ports, services, and vulnerabilities.

Creating a network scanner in Python for cybersecurity purposes can be an educational and practical project. Below is an outline of the project along with some code examples to get you started.

Project Overview
Objective:

To develop a Python-based network scanner that can discover devices on a local network, identify open ports, and provide basic information about the services running on these ports.
Features:

Device Discovery: Identify all devices connected to a given network.
Port Scanning: Scan open ports on discovered devices.
Service Detection: Identify services running on the open ports.
Reporting: Provide a summary report of the scanned network.
Tools and Libraries
Python: The core programming language.
Scapy: A powerful Python library for network manipulation and packet analysis.
socket: A built-in Python module for network communications.
argparse: A module for handling command-line arguments.
threading: To handle multiple scanning tasks simultaneously.
